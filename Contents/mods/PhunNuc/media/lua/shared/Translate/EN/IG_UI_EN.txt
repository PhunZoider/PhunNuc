For use on dedicated multiplayer servers, follow the instructions provided in spawnpoints.lua or check the mod's Steam Workshop page. <BR> <LEFT> Various settings, such as skill requirements or maintenance intervals, can be adjusted in the sandbox options to modify the level of difficulty. <BR> <LEFT> Recommendation: Avoid using the sledgehammer unnecessarily. All critical rooms can be accessed normally using the corresponding keys, which are created and registered during gameplay. <BR> <LEFT> The game can automatically remove incorrect entries for fallout zones, but these changes will only take effect after reloading the save. This is because the RadiatedZones mod reads the coordinates file only once when the game starts, and any runtime modifications to the file will not be applied until the next restart. Therefore, it is recommended to manually remove the entry from the file if a new save is started after the fallout event. <BR> <LEFT> Never set the ElecShutModifier value to 99999, because if the power plant isn't running, the mod will reset it to '0' when the game starts. <BR> <LEFT>"
